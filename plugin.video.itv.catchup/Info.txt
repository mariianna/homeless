For this plugin to work you must do the following:

1) Go into plugin settings and click on OK to exit (even if you haven't changed any settings - this will create the correct folder structure for you later on).
2) Run plugin and you should get a script error
3) Using Filemanager navigate to Q:\UserData\Plugin_Data\Video\ITV Catchup\
4) Create folder "Subtitles"
5) Create folder "Images"

It should now work, good luck!

If anyone would like to look at the code and make a fix I'm sure it must be pretty simple if you know what you're doing - unfortunately I don't!  If you do find a fix and would like to share please email me at englishnproud@gmail.com
