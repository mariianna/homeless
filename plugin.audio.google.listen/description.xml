    <summary>Google Listen audio add-on</summary>
    <description>Listen is a research Android app providing a personalized audio news-magazine loaded with fresh and interesting content whenever it is turned on. Start with directed search and streaming and then sit back or multi-task and Listen to content matching your favorite programs and queries like "ABC Nightline," "Bernanke," and "Fantasy Baseball." Currently we are indexing audio files from thousands of English-only RSS feeds but we plan to index all web audio, talking head videos, and short personalized text-to-speech segments in the future.</description>
