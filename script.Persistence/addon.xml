    <description>The script contained in this file is designed to provide a background server that holds persistent objects in memory and makes them available (via socket connections)to other client scripts and plugins. Please note that Persistence is an advanced developer's tool because it is useless as a standalone script, and any plugins or scripts that connect to it must be configured properly to act as clients.</description>
